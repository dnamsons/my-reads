# MyReads

This is a project for the Udacity React microdegree.

The solution is implemented using React hooks and functional components.

## Setup

```
  yarn install
  yarn start
```

OR

```
  npm install
  npm start
```

## Description

The project allows you to create and manage the books you'd like to read, are currently reading or have already read.

There are two main routes for this app. The first is the home view, where you can see the books that you've already saved in one of your bookshelves. The other route is search view, which allows you to find books that you can then add to one of your bookshelves.


### This project uses the following technologies:

* Udacity Book API to fetch books
* `create-react-app` for the project configuration
* `React` for the UI & interactivity
* `react-router` for url navigation
